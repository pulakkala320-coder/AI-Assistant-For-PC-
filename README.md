This project aims to develop a voice-driven AI assistant, inspired by Jarvis from Iron Man. Leveraging LiveKit for real-time audio streaming, the assistant provides seamless, interactive communication with the user. It listens to spoken commands, processes them using artificial intelligence, and executes tasks such as web searching, controlling the PC, and writing notes.

The system captures the userâ€™s voice through a microphone and transmits it to the backend via LiveKit. A speech-to-text (STT) engine, such as Whisper or Google Speech-to-Text, converts the audio into text. The text is then processed by a large language model (LLM) like GPT to understand the userâ€™s intent. Depending on the detected intent, the request is routed to one of three main modules:

Web Search â€“ Performs online searches using APIs (Google or Bing) and returns concise results.

PC Control â€“ Executes only predefined, whitelisted commands (like opening applications or locking the screen) for security.

Note Writing â€“ Saves user notes locally or in cloud storage such as Google Drive.

Once the assistant has generated a response, it converts the text into speech using TTS technologies, creating a natural and interactive voice reply. This completes a full interaction cycle: voice input â†’ AI processing â†’ voice output.

The architecture combines a React/Electron frontend, a Node.js backend with LiveKit SDK, and integrations for STT, LLM, and TTS. Security is a priority, with command whitelisting, localhost-only communication, and authentication tokens ensuring safe operation.

In practice, this assistant allows users to quickly fetch information, take notes, or control their PC hands-free. By integrating real-time audio streaming, intelligent intent recognition, and automation, the project delivers a futuristic, Jarvis-like experience, demonstrating how AI and system integration can create a truly smart personal assistant.

It's working on  [Python 3.10.11]

IF you run this file Frist of all create a vertual env and activate it then run this comund "pip install -r requirement.txt "
after all dependency install you can run it by this comund " python agent.py console".
